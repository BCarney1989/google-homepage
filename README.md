This project is recreating of the google homepage from scratch using the skills and information learned from the The Odin Project course. This isnt meant to be a prefect recreation of the website as the links dont work, but is meant to be a close visual copy to. 
After completing this project I feel that I demostrated the skills of writing html in a good fashion and finding creative ways to style using css and building good habits of trial and error and problem solving. I feel that this project put into prespective the importance of building html in a way that makes it clear and easy to track when it comes time to style the web page. Problem sovling is the skill that I look back on as one of the most important and challenging at this stage of my development. There were many times I would run into road blocks and I trouble shooting and googling the problem were key to learning how to do things such as applying images from my file and how to creating the navigation bars at the top and bottom of the page.
